## Project. Customer churn
### Description of the project
Customers began to leave Beta-Bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Banking marketers figured it was cheaper to keep current customers than to attract new ones.

It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Provided historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.

It is necessary to build a model with an extremely large *F1*-measure. It is necessary to bring the metric to at least 0.59.
Check *F1*-measure on the test set.

Additionally measure *AUC-ROC*, comparing its value with *F1*-measure.
