## Project. Determination of a prospective tariff for a telecom company
### Description of the project
Megaline is a federal mobile operator. Clients are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money.

It is necessary to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. The data of 500 Megaline users is available: who they are, where they are from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.

### Content of the project
1. Exploring general information about the data

2. Data preparation
     - Convert data to the required types;
     - Find and correct data errors.
     Calculate for each user:
     - the number of calls made and spent minutes of conversation by month;
     - the number of sent messages by month;
     - the amount of Internet traffic used by months;
     - monthly revenue from each user.

3. Data analysis
     - Describe the behavior of the operator's clients based on the sample.
     - How many minutes of conversation, how many messages and how much Internet traffic do users of each tariff need per month?

4. Hypothesis testing
     - Hypothesis 1 - The average revenue of users of "Ultra" and "Smart" tariffs differs;
     - Hypothesis 2 - The average revenue of users from Moscow differs from the revenue of users from other regions;
