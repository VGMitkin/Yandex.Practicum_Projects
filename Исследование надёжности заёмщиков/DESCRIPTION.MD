## Project. Borrower Reliability Study
### Short description

The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a **credit scoring** model - a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.

### Content of the project
1. Exploring general information about the data

2. Data preprocessing:
     - identifying and filling in missing values
     - replacement of a real data type with an integer one
     - remove duplicates
     - highlighting the lemma in the values of the column with the goals of obtaining a loan
     - data categorization
    
3. It is necessary to answer the questions:
     - Is there a relationship between having children and repaying the loan on time?
     - Is there a relationship between marital status and loan repayment on time?
     - Is there a relationship between the level of income and repayment of the loan on time?
     - How do different purposes of the loan affect its repayment on time?
