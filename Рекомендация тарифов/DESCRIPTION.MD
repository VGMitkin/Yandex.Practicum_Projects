## Project. Tariff recommendation
### Description of the project
The mobile operator "Megaline" found out that many customers use archival tariffs. They want to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and offer users a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra".

At the disposal of data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs. You need to build a model for the classification problem that will select the appropriate rate. Data preprocessing has already been done.

It is necessary to build a model with the largest possible *accuracy* value. You need to bring the percentage of correct answers to at least 0.75 and check *accuracy* on the test set.

### Content of the project
1 - Acquaintance with the data.
2 - Divide the initial data into training, validation and test sets.
3 - Study the quality of different models by changing the hyperparameters.
4 - Checking the quality of the model on a test sample.
5 - Checking the model for sanity.

### Libraries used in the project:
- pandas
- SKlearn
